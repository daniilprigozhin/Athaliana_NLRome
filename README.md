# NLRCladeFinder

The purpose of this repository is to help you find where your NLR sequence fits in the pan-NLRome of your species of interest.

Currently NLRCladeFinder supports Maize, Arabidopsis, and Soy NLRs.

To open the Colab notebook, click the file NLRCladeFinder.ipynb and then click "Open in Colab" button at the top of the file.

This will create a copy of the notebook where you can input your sequence of interest and also modify the code as you like.

Video walk through of the NLRCladeFinder is in the NLRCladeFinder_Tutorial.mp4 file.
